    "#### Brain Stroke Prediction\n",
    "- Built a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to suffer brain stroke or not, based on open source data with demographic and medical features.\n",
    "- Performed in-depth EDA to understand the distribution of the features in the dataset.\n",
    "- Carried out data processing techniques like variable encoding, imputation, feature scaling to prepare data for machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "- Used a gradient-boosting algorithm to train a model that yielded an F1 score of 99%\n",
    "- Deployed this model as an [interactive streamlit app](shorturl.at/abAEO)"
